Much like an assertion component, in an ABox, these represent facts associated with the conceptual model. symmetric resistance_associated_with None associated with resistance to response_affected_by holds between two chemical entities where the susceptibility of a biological entity or system (e.g. an organism, cell, cellular component, macromolecular machine mixin, biological or pathological process) of one is affected by the action of the other. affects response to response_decreased_by None decreases response to response_increased_by None increases response to risk_affected_by None affects risk for same_as holds between two entities that are considered equivalent to each other symmetric secretion_affected_by None affects secretion of secretion_decreased_by None decreases secretion of secretion_increased_by None increases secretion of sensitivity_associated_with None associated with sensitivity to sequence_location_of None has sequence location similar_to holds between an entity and some other entity with similar features. symmetric splicing_affected_by None affects splicing of splicing_decreased_by None decreases splicing of splicing_increased_by None increases splicing of stability_affected_by None affects stability of stability_decreased_by None decreases stability of stability_increased_by None increases stability of subclass_of holds between two classes where the domain class is a specialization of the range class superclass of superclass_of holds between two classes where the domain class is a super class of the range class subclass of synthesis_affected_by None affects synthesis of synthesis_decreased_by None decreases synthesis of synthesis_increased_by None increases synthesis of target_for A gene is a target of a disease when its products are druggable and when a drug interaction with the gene product could have a therapeutic effect has target taxon_of None in taxon temporally_related_to holds between two entities with a temporal relationship symmetric transcribed_from x is transcribed from y if and only if x is synthesized from template y transcribed to transcribed_to inverse of transcribed from transcribed from translates_to x (amino acid chain/polypeptide) is the ribosomal translation of y (transcript) if and only if a ribosome reads y (transcript) through a series of triplet codon-amino acid adaptor activities (GO:0030533) and produces x (amino acid chain/polypeptide) translation of translation_of inverse of translates to translates to transport_affected_by None affects transport of transport_decreased_by None decreases transport of transport_increased_by None increases transport of treated_by holds between a disease or phenotypic feature and a therapeutic process or chemical entity that is used to treat the condition treats treats holds between a therapeutic procedure or chemical entity and a disease or phenotypic feature that it is used to treat treated by uptake_affected_by None affects uptake of uptake_decreased_by None decreases uptake of uptake_increased_by None increases uptake of variant_part_of None has variant part xenologous_to a homology relationship characterized by an interspecies (horizontal) transfer since the common ancestor. symmetric","title":"Predicates"},{"location":"#annotation-edge-properties","text":"Property Description aggregator_knowledge_source An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path to its current serialized form. anatomical_context_qualifier A statement qualifier representing an anatomical location where an relationship expressed in an association took place (can be a tissue, cell type, or subcellular location). aspect_qualifier Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which the core concept participates, a function/activity/role held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that inheres in the core concept. associated_environmental_context An attribute that can be applied to an association where the association holds between two entities located or occurring in a particular environment. For example, two microbial taxa may interact in the context of a human gut; a disease may give rise to a particular phenotype in a particular environmental exposure. association_slot any slot that relates an association to another entity association_type connects an association to the category of association (e.g. gene to phenotype) base_coordinate A position in the base coordinate system. Base coordinates start at position 1 instead of position 0. catalyst_qualifier a qualifier that connects an association between two causally connected entities (for example, two chemical entities, or a chemical entity in that changes location) and the gene product, gene, or complex that enables or catalyzes the change. causal_mechanism_qualifier A statement qualifier representing a type of molecular control mechanism through which an effect of a chemical on a gene or gene product is mediated (e.g. 'agonism', 'inhibition', 'allosteric modulation', 'channel blocker') chi_squared_statistic represents the chi-squared statistic computed from observations clinical_modifier_qualifier the method or process of administering a pharmaceutical compound to achieve a therapeutic effect in humans or animals. context_qualifier Restricts the setting/context/location where the core concept (or qualified core concept) resides or occurs. derivative_qualifier A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object concept to describe something that is derived from the core concept.

May be cell, tissue, or organ. FDA_approval_status form_or_variant_qualifier A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object concept to define a specific type, variant, alternative version of this concept. The composed concept remains a subtype or instance of the core concept. For example, the qualifier \u2018mutation\u2019 combines with the core concept \u2018Gene X\u2019 to express the compose concept \u2018a mutation of Gene X\u2019. frequency_qualifier a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how frequent the phenotype is observed in the subject genome_build The version of the genome on which a feature is located. For example, GRCh38 for Homo sapiens. has_confidence_level connects an association to a qualitative term denoting the level of confidence has_evidence connects an association to an instance of supporting evidence has_population_context a biological population (general, study, cohort, etc.) with a specific set of characteristics to constrain an association. has_temporal_context a constraint of time placed upon the truth value of an association. interacting_molecules_category None interbase_coordinate A position in interbase coordinates. Interbase coordinates start at position 0 instead of position 1. This is applied to a sequence localization edge. knowledge_source An Information Resource from which the knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved, directly or indirectly. This can be any resource through which the knowledge passed on its way to its currently serialized form. In practice, implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property. logical_interpretation None mechanism_of_action a boolean flag to indicate if the edge is part of a path or subgraph of a knowledge graph that constitutes the mechanism of action for a result. negated if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true object connects an association to the object of the association. For example, in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object. object_aspect_qualifier None object_context_qualifier None object_derivative_qualifier None object_direction_qualifier None object_form_or_variant_qualifier None object_part_qualifier None onset_qualifier a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state when the phenotype appears is in the subject original_object used to hold the original object of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. original_predicate used to hold the original relation/predicate that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. original_subject used to hold the original subject of a relation (or predicate) that an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification. p_value A quantitative confidence value that represents the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme as that actually obtained, assuming that the actual value was the result of chance alone. part_qualifier defines a specific part/component of the core concept (used in cases there this specific part has no IRI we can use to directly represent it, e.g. 'ESR1 transcript' q: polyA tail). phase The phase for a coding sequence entity. For example, phase of a CDS as represented in a GFF3 with a value of 0, 1 or 2. phenotypic_state in experiments (e.g. gene expression) assaying diseased or unhealthy tissue, the phenotypic state can be put here, e.g. MONDO ID. For healthy tissues, use XXX. population_context_qualifier a biological population (general, study, cohort, etc.) with a specific set of characteristics to constrain an association. predicate A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate. This is analogous to category for nodes. primary_knowledge_source The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association that an implementer can identify (may or may not be the 'original' source). publications connects an association to publications supporting the association qualified_predicate predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers are present and the full reading of the statement requires a qualification to the predicate in use in order to refine or increase the specificity of the full statement reading qualifiers connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning of that association quantifier_qualifier A measurable quantity for the object of the association reaction_balanced None reaction_direction the direction of a reaction as constrained by the direction_enum (ie: left_to_right, neutral, etc.) reaction_side the side of a reaction being modeled (ie: left or right) sequence_localization_attribute An attribute that can be applied to a genome sequence localization edge. These edges connect a nucleic acid entity such as an exon to an entity such as a chromosome. Edge properties are used to ascribe specific positional information and other metadata to the localization. In pragmatic terms this can be thought of as columns in a GFF3 line. sequence_variant_qualifier a qualifier used in an association with the variant severity_qualifier a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state how severe the phenotype is in the subject sex_qualifier a qualifier used in a phenotypic association to state whether the association is specific to a particular sex. species_context_qualifier A statement qualifier representing a taxonomic category of species in which a relationship expressed in an association took place. stage_qualifier stage during which gene or protein expression of takes place. start_coordinate The position at which the subject genomic entity starts on the chromosome or other entity to which it is located on.

Once researchers have examined the possibilities a new drug may contain, they must do preliminary research to determine its potential for harm (toxicity). This is categorized as preclinical research and can be one of two types: in vitro or in vivo. FDA Clinical Research Phase None Clinical Research Phase. Clinical research involves trials of the drug on people, and it is one of the most involved stages in the drug development and approval process. Clinical trials must answer specific questions and follow a protocol determined by the drug researcher or manufacturer. FDA Review Phase 4 None FDA Review FDA Post-Market Safety Monitoring None FDA Post-Market Safety Monitoring. The last phase of drug approval is an ongoing one while the drug is on the marketplace. If a developer wants to change anything about the drug formulation or approve it for a new use, they must apply with the FDA. The FDA also frequently reviews the drug\u2019s advertising and its manufacturing facility to make sure everything involved in its creation and marketing is in compliance with regulations. FDA Clinical Research Phase 1 None In the FDA Clinical Research Phase, the Clinical Research Phase 1 involves 20 \u2013 100 study participants and lasts several months. This phase is used to determine the safety and dosage of the drug, and about 70% of these drugs move on to the next clinical research phase. FDA Clinical Research Phase 2 None In the FDA Clinical Research Phase, the Clinical Research Phase 2 involves up to several hundred people, who must have the disease or condition the drug supposes to treat. This phase can last from a few months to two years, and its purpose is to monitor the efficacy of the drug, as well as note side effects that may occur. FDA Clinical Research Phase 3 None In the FDA Clinical Research Phase, the Clinical Research Phase 3 involves 300 \u2013 3000 volunteers and can last up to four years. It is used to continue monitoring the efficacy of the drug, as well as exploring any longer-term adverse reactions. FDA Clinical Research Phase 4 None In the FDA Clinical Research Phase, the Clinical Research Phase 4 involves several thousands of volunteers who have the disease or condition and continues to monitor safety and efficacy. If a drug passes this phase, it goes on to FDA review. FDA Fast Track None Fast track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need.

A positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease is known as \u201cclinical benefit\u201d. Mindful of the fact that it may take an extended period of time to measure a drug\u2019s intended clinical benefit, in 1992 FDA instituted the Accelerated Approval regulations. These regulations allowed drugs for serious conditions that filled an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint. Using a surrogate endpoint enabled the FDA to approve these drugs faster.

In 1992, under the Prescription Drug User Act (PDUFA), FDA agreed to specific goals for improving the drug review time and created a two-tiered system of review times \u2013 Standard Review and Priority Review. A Priority Review designation means FDA\u2019s goal is to take action on an application within 6 months (compared to 10 months under standard review).

Conversely, for more specific associations (like 'gene to disease association', the publication should be captured as an edge property). classDiagram Association <|-- InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : aggregator_knowledge_source InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : category InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : description InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : has_attribute InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : has_evidence InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : id InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : iri InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : knowledge_source InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : name InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : negated InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : object InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : original_knowledge_source InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : predicate InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : primary_knowledge_source InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : publications InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : qualifiers InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : source InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : subject InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : timepoint InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation : type","title":"InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation"},{"location":"InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation/#parent-classes","text":"Entity Association InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation","title":"Parent Classes"},{"location":"InformationContentEntityToNamedThingAssociation/#slots","text":"Name Description aggregator_knowledge_source An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path to its current serialized form. category Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.

In Biolink Model all the curation should happen in one place: biolink-model.yaml This is the one source of truth for the model. This section explores how to go about adding new classes and slots to the model. Adding an Entity class An entity class represents entities like Genes, Diseases, Chemical Substances, etc. Instances of these Entity classes are represented as nodes in a graph. Biolink Model has several entity classes like gene , disease , phenotypic feature , chemical substance . All these classes are arranged in a hierarchy with the root of all entities being the named thing class. To add an entity class to Biolink Model you need to determine the following, - What is an appropriate name for this entity? - The name for an entity should be clear and concise. It should describe instances of this class - Where in the named thing hierarchy does the new class fit? - Determine what the immediate parent for this class is going to be - What are the slots that this class can have (in addition to its inherited slots)? - Determine what additional properties that this class ought to have - Do certain slots have to be constrained to certain values? - Determine whether there are properties (new or inherited) whose value have to be constrained to a certain value space - What are the valid namespace prefixes for identifiers of instances of this class? - For representing an instance of this entity class determine the identifier namespace and valid prefix(es) - What are the mapping(s) for this class? - Mappings are a way of rooting this new entity classs in the context of other ontologies, thesauri, controlled vocabularies and taxonomies - Determine the level of granularity for your mappings where they can be divided into 5 types: related_mappings , broad_mappings , narrow_mappings close_mappings , exact_mappings As an example, let's consider the definition of the entity class gene : gene: is_a: gene or gene product aliases: ['locus'] slots: - id - name - symbol - description - synonym - xref exact_mappings: - SO:0000704 - SIO:010035 - WIKIDATA:Q7187 id_prefixes: - NCBIGene - ENSEMBL - HGNC - UniProtKB - MGI - ZFIN - dictyBase - WB - WormBase - FlyBase - FB - RGD - SGD - PomBase In the above YAML snippet, is_a , aliases , slots , exact_mappings , and id_prefixes are slots from linkML where each slot has a specific meaning and they add semantics to the class definition. In addition to the aforementioned slots, linkML provides ways to leverage mixin classes to reuse certain slots across different classes. Say you want to use the mixin class thing with taxon that defines an in taxon slot. You can achieve that as follows: gene: is_a: gene or gene product mixins: - thing with taxon aliases: ['locus'] ... In the above YAML snippet, we are explicitly defining the entity class gene to have in taxon as a slot in addition to all its slots, its parent slots, and all of its ancestor slots. There are other linkML slots that can be used to define your class and further capture the semantics of your class. For more information on what each slot means and how to use them in Biolink Model, refer to Using the Modeling Language . Adding an Association class An association represents an assertion (statement) which connects a subject to an object via a predicate. Instances of the Association class are represented as edges in a graph. Biolink Model has several Association classes like gene to gene association , gene to disease association , disease to phenotypic feature association . All these classes are arranged in a hierarchy with the root of all associations being the association class. To add an Association class to Biolink Model you need to determine the following, - What is an appropriate name for this association - The name for an association should be clear and concise. It should capture the type of assertion that it is trying to represent - What type of nodes does this association link? - Determine what the subject and the object classes are in this assertion - Where in the hierarchy does the new class fit? - Determine where in the association slot hierarchy does this new assocation class fit - What are the slots that this association class can have (in addition to inherited slots)? - Determine what additional properties that this class ought to have - Do certain slots have to be constrained on what values it ought to have? - Determine whethere there are properties (new or inherited) whose value have to be constrained to a certain value space - What are the mapping(s) for this class? - Mappings are a way of rooting this new association in the context of other ontologies, thesauri, controlled vocabularies and taxonomies - Determine the level of granularity for your mappings where they can be divided into 5 types: related_mappings , broad_mappings , narrow_mappings close_mappings , exact_mappings As an example, let's consider the definition of class variant to disease association : variant to disease association: is_a: association defining_slots: - subject - object mixins: - variant to thing association - entity to disease association slot_usage: subject: description: >- a sequence variant in which the allele state is associated in some way with the disease state examples: - value: ClinVar:52241 description: \"NM_000059.3(BRCA2):c.7007G>C (p.Arg2336Pro)\" relation: description: >- E.g. is pathogenic for subproperty_of: related condition object: description: >- a disease that is associated with that variant examples: - value: MONDO:0016419 description: hereditary breast cancer In the above YAML snippet, is_a , defining_slots , mixins , and slot_usage are slots from linkML where each slot has a specific meaning and they add semantics to the class definition. There are other linkML slots that can be used to define your class and represent the semantics of your class. For more information on what each slot means and how to use them in Biolink Model, refer to Using the Modeling Language . Adding a predicate/relation A predicate is a slot that links two instances of a class. To add a predicate to Biolink Model you need to determine the following, - What is an appropriate name for this predicate? - A human readable name for this predicate. It should capture the nature of the relationship - Where in the hierarchy does the new slot fit? - Determine where in the related to hierarchy does this new predicate slot fit - What are the domain and range constraints (if any)? - Determine which type of entity classes can this predicate link - What are the mapping(s) for this slot? - Mappings are a way of rooting this new association in the context of other ontologies, thesauri, controlled vocabularies and taxonomies - Determine the level of granularity for your mappings where they can be divided into 5 types: related_mappings , broad_mappings , narrow_mappings close_mappings , exact_mappings # TODO: add the predicate discussion about inverse of cannon to this document. - Determine the inverse of the predicate, and add it (specifying the inverse property on each of the two predicates) - In general, the canonical direction of the predicate should contain the descriptive information about the predicate while its inverse can be minimally defined. As an example, let's consider the definition of slot interacts with : interacts with: domain: named thing range: named thing description: >- holds between any two entities that directly or indirectly interact with each other is_a: related to in_subset: - translator_minimal symmetric: true exact_mappings: - RO:0002434 narrow_mappings: - RO:0002103 - RO:0002120 - RO:0002130 - SEMMEDDB:complicates In the above YAML snippet, domain , range , description , is_a , in_subset , symmetric , exact_mappings and narrow_mappings are slots from linkML where each slot has a specific meaning and they add semantics to the slot definition. For more information on what each slot means and how to use them in Biolink Model, refer to Using the Modeling Language . Adding properties You can add slots that represent node properties or edge properties. To add a node/edge property to Biolink Model you need to determine the following, - What is an appropriate name for this slot? - A human readable name for this property - Is it a node property or an edge property (association slot)? - Determine whether the property is a node or an edge property - Where in the hierarchy does the new property fit? - Determine where in the property hierarchy does this new property fit - If you want to add a node property then it should be added as part of the node property hierarchy - If you want to add an edge property then it should be added as part of the association slot hierarchy - Is this a required property? - Determine whether all instances of a class must have a value for this property - What are the domain and range constraints (if any)? - Determine which type of classes can have this property and what the value space for this property should be - What are the mapping(s) for this slot? - Mappings are a way of rooting this new property in the context of other ontologies, thesauri, controlled vocabularies and taxonomies - Determine the level of granularity for your mappings where they can be divided into 5 types: related_mappings , broad_mappings , narrow_mappings close_mappings , exact_mappings As an example, let's consider the slot name which is a node property: name: is_a: node property aliases: ['label', 'display name'] domain: named thing range: label type description: >- A human-readable name for a thing in_subset: - translator_minimal required: true slot_uri: rdfs:label exact_mappings: - gff3:Name - gpi:DB_Object_Name As another example, let's consider the slot relation which is an edge property: relation: is_a: association slot description: >- The relation which describes an association between a subject and an object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology, but it can be any edge CURIE. domain: association range: uriorcurie required: true In the above YAML snippets, is_a , aliases , domain , range , description , in_subset , required , slot_uri , exact_mappings are slots from linkML where each slot has a specific meaning and they add semantics to the slot definition. There are other linkML slots that can be used to define your class and represent the semantics of your class. For more information on what each slot means and how to use them in Biolink Model, refer to Using the Modeling Language . Managing mappings In the previous sections there were references to mappings and differentiating these mappings based on their granularity, which can be a bit of a nuanced exercise. What does it mean for a external concept (or predicate or property) to be one of related_mappings , broad_mappings , narrow_mappings close_mappings , exact_mappings ? Here is a rule of thumb on how to determine the granularity of mapping: - An external concept can be considered as an exact mapping to a Biolink Model class or slot if the former can be used interchangeably with the latter. That is, the semantics are identical and any transitive property that the external concept might bring into the model should not violate the internal consistency of the model - If it is difficult to determine if an external concept can be considered an exact mapping then it is much safer to treat it as a close mapping - If an external concept can be treated a sub-class of the Biolink Model class or slot then it can be treated as a narrow mapping - If an external concept can be treated as a super-class of the Biolink Model class or slot then it can be treated as a broad mapping - If an external concept is distantly related to a Biolink Model class or slot then it can be treated as a related mapping","title":"Updating"},{"location":"curating-the-model/#curating-the-biolink-model","text":"Before curating the Biolink Model, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the basics of LinkML .

What does it mean for a external concept (or predicate or property) to be one of related_mappings , broad_mappings , narrow_mappings close_mappings , exact_mappings ? Here is a rule of thumb on how to determine the granularity of mapping: - An external concept can be considered as an exact mapping to a Biolink Model class or slot if the former can be used interchangeably with the latter. That is, the semantics are identical and any transitive property that the external concept might bring into the model should not violate the internal consistency of the model - If it is difficult to determine if an external concept can be considered an exact mapping then it is much safer to treat it as a close mapping - If an external concept can be treated a sub-class of the Biolink Model class or slot then it can be treated as a narrow mapping - If an external concept can be treated as a super-class of the Biolink Model class or slot then it can be treated as a broad mapping - If an external concept is distantly related to a Biolink Model class or slot then it can be treated as a related mapping","title":"Managing

Although specific to Neo4j, these recommendations should hold for any Labeled Property Graph (LPG) model, e.g a Python networkx graph (specifically a MultiDiGraph ). For mapping to RDF graphs refer to Mapping to RDF . Nodes All nodes in the Neo4j database should be to NamedThing . Biolink Model defines a typology of nodes, all of which inherit from NamedThing . Nodes in Neo4j (and property graphs in general) may have node properties . The NamedThing class defines core properties for a node, plus additional (optional) ones. Core properties for a node: - id - name - category In the core bl model, each node must have an ID which is a CURIE [informative] when mapping nodes to RDF, the node ID MUST correspond to the IRI using the link json-ld context [normative] Note: this is distinct from the internal autogenerated id field in Neo4j. The name field SHOULD correspond to a concise display label for the entity. For example asthma or Wnt signaling pathway . If the node is an ontology class then name will correspond to the rdfs:label of that class. Any Neo4j instance MAY provide as many additional properties as required. These SHOULD come from a registered list of properties for that node type. For example, the Genotype class provides a property has_zygosity , which is specific to that class (and its sub-classes, if any). Note: While the CURIE for a property is biolink:name that does not necessarily mean the property name has to be biolink:name in Neo4j. Instead, the prefix part of the property can be omitted such that the property name is just name . Use of Neo4j labels Nodes in Neo4j can be tagged with label(s) indicating a grouping to which the node belongs. The category field in the model MUST map to a Neo4j label. The Biolink Model class name in CamelCase MUST be used for the category field. Additionally, the Neo4j implementation MAY have additional categories which are super-classes of a specific category. For example, if a node representing a particular type of neuron has category Cell , then the Neo4j graph may also tag the node with AnatomicalEntity as label, in addition to Cell . Consequently, any number of additional local labels MAY also be used. In addition to Neo4j labels, additional subclass of edges may be used to connect a node to an ontology class node. Implementation Note: Cypher queries that use labels are optimized for speed, under the assumption that an index has already been generated in Neo4j for said label(s). Terminology note: The term label is overloaded. In RDF it usually denotes the name of an entity ( rdfs:label ). For this reason we use category as the property name in Biolink Model. Edges Each edge in the Neo4j graph should have an edge label or relationship type that is a sub-property of related_to . For example, two protein nodes may be related via physically_interacts_with relationship type. Note: Always use snake_case to represent edge labels. The set of edge labels is deliberately kept minimal. This is partly for practical reasons. Neo4j has no easy way to automatically use sub-property relationship types in Cypher queries. For example, if we have a deep hierarchy of interaction relationships including specific physical interactions such as 'phosphorylates', then queries for any kind of interaction must be expanded to include all sub-property relationship types. More precise relationship types are allowed through the use of relation property. Edge properties Neo4j uses a property graph model, where any number of properties can be attached to an edge. Some properties may be generic, while some may only pertain to particular kinds of relationship type. Edges SHOULD have a relation property which encodes the most specific relationship type for the relationship. This MAY correspond to the edge label, or it MAY be more specific. The relation property MUST be encoded as a CURIE or IRI. Edges can also have generic properties that changes the meaning of the edge itself. For example, the generic property negated which logically negates the assertion defined by the edge. Association types Biolink Model includes a hierarchy of Association . Note: This is distinct from the relation hierarchy, although in some cases they parallel one another. For example, the relation hierarchy has a generic relation part_of . This can be used in different contexts. For example, connecting two anatomical entities, or connecting a pathway to a sub-pathway. Formally, the Association hierarchy is a classification of edge objects. Any edge SHOULD be mappable to an association_type , using the subject's category, edge's relation and object's category. Different association types may have different properties associated with them. The core properties are: - subject - object - edge_label * - relation Note: 3 of these properties are builtin, so these do not correspond to edge properties (but they may, for the sake of verbosity). The edge_label is a snake_case human-readable high-level grouping relationship.

In RDF, a graph is a collection of triples <S P O> (subject predicate object). The S and P must be RDF resources (nodes). The O can be a literal or a resource. Graphs are organized into collections of Named Graphs. Each triple can be conceived of as a quad <S P O G> . Node and node properties Each node in a graph corresponds to an RDF resource. Biolink Model defines a typology of nodes, all of which inherit from biolink:NamedThing . Core properties for a node: - biolink:id - biolink:iri - biolink:name - biolink:category The biolink:id MUST be provided and MUST be a CURIE, which maps to the resource IRI/URI using a standard prefix expansion. The RDF graph MAY include the CURIE short-form represented with the predicate dcterms:identifier where the CURIE itself is a literal. The biolink:name field SHOULD correspond to a concise label for the entity, and maps to rdfs:label . For example, the biolink node with ID MONDO:0001083 and name Fanconi syndrome will be expressed in RDF (turtle syntax) as: PREFIX MONDO: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_> PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> MONDO:0001083 rdfs:label \"Fanconi syndrome\" When the CURIEs are expanded this will be rendered as: <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0001083> <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label> \"Fanconi syndrome\" . Types and Categories To define the type of a node, you can use the rdf:type to link to a specific node type. You MAY use the predicate biolink:category to represent additional categories for that node. The rdf:type triples MAY be partitioned into separate named graphs. For example, it can be convenient to put the direct rdf:type assertion in the main graph and the inferred/index (ie asserted plus inferred) in a separate 'inferred' graph. Additional node properties You MAY provide as many additional properties as required. These SHOULD come from a registered list of properties for that node type. Edge and edge properties An edge maps to an RDF triple where both the subject and object are nodes representing Biolink entities. RDF reification is used for representing edge properties. RDF* provides a convenient syntax for abstracting over this. So for example, an edge between x and y with edge label p and an additional edge property publication=PMID:123 would be represented in RDF* as: <<:x :p :y>> bl:publication <http://identifiers.org/pmid/123>. This is syntactic sugar for the more verbose reification triples: :x :p :y . [a rdf:Statement ; rdf:subject :x ; rdf:predicate :p ; rdf:object :y ; bl:publication http://identifiers.org/pmid/123 ]. The jury is still out on the question whether referring to an RDF triple also asserts the triple. Therefore in some RDF implementations you need to assert it explicitly if you need to have it as a direct triple, similar to the RDF Reification example below: :x :p :y. <<:x :p :y>> bl:publication <http://identifiers.org/pmid/123>. (For example, GraphDB's RDF* does not assert automatically.) See biolink:Association for a taxonomy of associations defined by the model, and to see a list of generic properties that are associated with an edge.

representing biological and biomedical knowledge. The model itself is agnostic to the graph formalism used to represent knowledge. i.e. You can use Biolink Model as a schema for labelled property graphs (Neo4j) or for edge labelled graphs (RDF). Biolink Model was built with the following aims: - Bridge between labelled property graphs and edge labelled graphs - Formal representation where the semantics are well defined within the model - Focus on the actual schema and its semantics instead of being weighed down by limitations of a technology - Extensible, self-documenting, and unambiguous - Maps to external ontologies, thesauri, controlled vocabularies, and taxonomies To that end, Biolink Model makes use of linkML (Biolink Modeling Language) for defining the various semantics of the model. Understanding the Biolink Modeling Language linkML is a general purpose modeling language that follows object-oriented and ontological principles. The modeling language inherits features from the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and thus is capable of representing semantics in addition to the standard object-oriented hierarchy of a data model. Models are authored in YAML; using linkML one can generate a variety of artifacts including JSON-Schema, OWL, RDF, Python data classes, Shape Expressions, and Markdown. The modeling language provides the following idioms, - Class definition - Used to define classes - Slot definition - Used to define class properties - Type definition - Used to define data types - Schema definition - Used to define properties of the model itself Refer to linkML on GitHub for a more detailed guide on linkML. Note: Biolink Model is authored using linkML. While Biolink Model and linkML share a \"Biolink\" in its name, that is where the similarities end. One can use linkML to author any schema for any domain. Structure of the Model Biolink Model is a high-level data model where entities, associations, and predicates are arranged in a hierarchy. The model also defines node properties, edge properties, and types. The model itself is organized using linkML Class definition (class), Slot definition (slot), Type definition (type) and Schema definition. Conventions In Biolink Model YAML any class, slot, or type is defined in sentence case form. When this model is compiled to various forms (like JSON-Schema, OWL, Markdown) the representation is based on the following convention, - classes are named in CamelCase form - slots are named in snake_case form - types are named in snake_case form To avoid ambiguity in semantics, prefixes are MUST for classes and certain slots. To avoid ambuguity it semantics, prefixes are RECOMMENDED for all slots. At a glance the structure is as follows, - Classes - Entities - Associations - Mixins - Slots - Predicates - Node Properties - Edge Properties - Types Classes A class represents an entity or an association. A class can have one more more slots (properties). In RDF sense, a class is basically rdfs:Class . Within the Biolink Model there are two hierarchies of classes: - Named Things - Associations where Named Things are disjoint from Associations. But they do share a common ancestor class: entity Named Things Named Things are classes that represent real world entities such as genes, diseases, chemical substances, etc. In a graph formalism, 'Named Things' are represented by nodes in a graph. Each class in the named thing has one or more slots (properties). The root of all entities is the named thing class. Note: While we say named thing when defining the model using linkML, the actual CURIE for this class is biolink:NamedThing Associations Associations are classes that represent an assertion or statement. In RDF sense, an association is an rdf:Statement . In a graph formalism, associations are represented using edges in a graph. Each class has one or more slots (or properties). The root of all associations is the association class. Note: While we say association when defining the model using linkML, the acutal CURIE for this class is biolink:Association Mixins Mixins are classes that contain slots (properties) or slots which embody a generic slot semantic definition, for use across several other classes or slots. Mixins are abstract classes/slots and they cannot be instantiated by themselves. That is, there cannot be an instance of a mixin class or slot value (e.g. predicate slot) used as 'data'. However, a class mixin may be given as the domain or range specification of an association or a mixin slot may be given as a subproperty_of constraint, with the strict understanding that when the given association or slot is deployed as an element in a knowledge graph, that the actual values used in the instantiated nodes and edges of the graph will be \"concrete\" classes or slots that have or inherited those mixin elements as mixins . Mixins are defined as a way of encouraging reuse of specific slots (properties) while ensuring a clear inheritance chain. For example, the entity to feature or disease qualifiers class is a mixin that defines slots severity qualifier and onset qualifier . The mixin also inherits the slot frequency qualifier from its parent mixin class frequency qualifier mixin . The mixin class entity to feature or disease qualifiers is used in the entity to phenotypic feature association class and thus by design the class will have severity qualifier , onset qualifier , and frequency qualifier in addition to all other slots it inherits from its own parent association class. Note: Even though entity to phenotypic feature association uses the mixin class entity to feature or disease qualifiers that does not mean that entity to phenotypic feature association is a child of entity to feature or disease qualifiers . i.e. Mixins do not contribute to the inheritance hierarchy of the class that uses them. Slots In Biolink Model, slots represent properties that a class can have. A slot is similar to rdf:Property where it can link - an instance of a class to another instance of a class - an instance of a class to a literal/data type In Biolink Model slots are used to represent - Predicates - Node Properties - Edge Properties Predicates Predicates are slots that connect instances of classes. In a graph formalism, predicates are relationships that link two instances. In an OWL sense, predicates are similar to owl:ObjectProperty . For example, a predicate treats can be used to link an instance of class chemical substance with an instance of class disease . Node Properties Node properties are slots that an entity class (i.e, a node) can have. The root of all node properties is node property slot. In an OWL sense, node properties are similar to owl:DataTypeProperty . For example, symbol , synonym , and xref are children of the node property slot and they are assigned to the entity class named thing . So all instances of this class can have symbol , synonym , and xref as properties that further describes the instance. Note: In many cases you may see node properties without the biolink prefix. This is normal since we can assume that if there is a biolink typed node in a graph, with id and name as its properties, then they correspond to biolink:id and biolink:name . But to be sure of the semantics it is advised to use the full CURIE to represent property names in your graph. Edge Properties Edge properties are slots that an association class (i.e., an edge) can have. The root of all edge properties is association slot slot. In an OWL sense, edge properties are similar to owl:DataTypeProperty . For example, subject , predicate , and object are children of the association_slot slot and they are assigned to association class association . So all instances of this class can have subject , predicate , and object as its properties that further describes the instance. Note: In many cases you may see edge properties without the biolink prefix. This is normal since we can assume that if there is a biolink typed edge in a graph with subject , predicate , and object as its properties then they correspond to biolink:subject , biolink:predicate , and biolink:object , respectively. But to be sure of the semantics it is advised to use the full CURIE to represent property names in your graph. Types linkML provides a handful of inbuilt data types. But you can also define custom data types using the modeling language. In Biolink Model we have several data types. Data types do not have any inheritance and thus are not arranged in any hierarchy. For example, iri type is a type defined in the Biolink Model where the value space is constrained to uriorcurie . Note : uriorcurie is an inbuilt data type provided by linkML where the value space is constrained to either a URI or a CURIE representation.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"understanding-the-model/#understanding-the-biolink-model","text":"Biolink Model is a high-level data model built to provide a schema for representing biological and biomedical knowledge.

This document tries to address on how to use most of these slots in Biolink Model. Please refer to linkML documentation for an exhaustive list of slots provided by the modeling language. Inheritance Related Slots is_a The is_a slot can be used to define a hierarchy for your Biolink Model class, mixin or slot where a new class, mixin or slot is defined as a subclass of another defined class, mixin or slot. gene: is_a: gene or gene product Here we define that the entity class gene is a sub-class of gene or gene product . Note that is_a has the characteristics of homeomorphicity: is_a SHOULD only connect either (1) two mixins (2) two classes (3) two slots. abstract A model class (or slot) may be tagged with its abstract slot set to the boolean value true , to define whether it is abstract. This has comparable meaning to that in the computing science Object Oriented Paradigm: another class (or slot) can use the abstract class (or slot) as part of its inheritance hierarchy, but the abstract class itself cannot be directly instantiated. cell line to thing association: is_a: association defining_slots: - subject abstract: true description: >- A relationship between a cell line and another entity slot_usage: subject: range: cell line Here we define that the association class cell line to thing association is an abstract class. In this case, the class simply constrains its child subclasses to have a subject range of biolink:CellLine . mixin The mixin:true demarkation is used to extend the properties (or slots) of a class, without changing its position in the class hierarchy. Mixins can be extremely helpful in a number of ways: 1) to generalize a set of attributes that can apply to classes in different parts of the class hierarchy, 2) reduce duplication of shared attributes between classes that do not inherit from one another and 3) to prevent the sometimes confusing nature of multiple inheritance noted in the '[diamond problem]'(https://tinyurl.com/4zdw9tsb). In general, while mixin slots and classes should not be directly instantiated, or used directly as a slot in a class, KGs can use them as a substitute for multiple inheritance. For example, a KG might wish to determine what are the parents of a certain class. In this case, the KG should navigate a mixin used in a domain or range of a class or slot, as it would the \"is_a\" demarkation. thing with taxon: mixin: true description: >- A mixin that can be used on any entity with a taxon slots: - in taxon Here we define the class thing with taxon as a mixin class with a slot in taxon . molecular entity: is_a: biological entity mixins: - thing with taxon - physical essence - ontology class aliases: ['bioentity'] In the class molecular entity , we use the thing with taxon mixin in order to add the 'in taxon' attribute (slot) to the molecular entity class. The other way to do this would be to duplicate the 'in taxon' attribute in every class manually (duplicative), or have hierarchy/parent that had the in taxon slot (but this parent would be a sister-class to 'named thing' as not all named-things are taxon based). Mixins simplify modeling and should be used when necessary. regulates: is_a: affects comments: - This is a grouping for process-process and entity-entity relations mixin: true Here we define the slot regulates as a mixin slot. This slot can be used as a mixin by other slots. Mixins can also be hierarchical. For example: frequency qualifier mixin: mixin: true description: >- Qualifier for frequency type associations slots: - frequency qualifier Here we define the mixin frequency qualifier mixin to hold the parent slot, frequency qualifier. The slot, frequency qualifier is then inherited by every class in the subsequent is_a hierarchy of entity to feature or disease qualifiers mixin. The frequency quantifier mixin was created with similar intentions (favoring consistency in modeling similar domains), though its reuse is not as evident in the model yet. Mixins provide the means of reusing semantics, generally by the inclusion of specific property slots or other semantic constraint, in different classes or slots, without the need to tie slots to the hierarchy of the class itself. positively regulates: comments: - This is a grouping for positive process-process and entity-entity regulation. is_a: regulates inverse: positively regulated by mixin: true close_mappings: # This RTX contributed term is tagged as a inverse of this Biolink predicate - RO:0002336 exact_mappings: - RO:0002213 narrow_mappings: - CHEMBL.MECHANISM:activator - DGIdb:activator - RO:0004032 - RO:0004034 - RO:0002629 - SEMMEDDB:augments positively regulates is another example of a mixin. In this case, a mixin is used to store meta data about a predicate or relationship between two entities at a general level. Its subsequent children, inherit these definitions and attributes, whether or not the parent mixin class has any slots. mixins The mixins slot can be used to specify a list of mixins that a class (or slot) can use to include the added semantics of the mixins. The mixins are separate from the is_a hierarchy and the mixin classes do not contribute to a classes inheritance hierarchy. individual organism: is_a: organismal entity mixins: - thing with taxon Here we define an entity class individual organism that uses the mixin class thing with taxon . By virtue of the mixin, the class individual organism will have an in taxon slot in addition to all its own slots, its parent slots, and its ancestor slots. Identification, Descriptive and Indexing Related Slots aliases The aliases slot can be used to define a list of aliases for a Biolink Model class (or slot). This is useful for adding synonymous names to your class (or slot). gene: is_a: gene or gene product aliases: - locus Here we define that the entity class gene has an alias locus . description The description slot can be used to provide a human-readable description of a class (or slot). genetically interacts with: is_a: interacts with description: >- holds between two genes whose phenotypic effects are dependent on each other in some way - such that their combined phenotypic effects are the result of some interaction between the activity of their gene products. Examples include epistasis and synthetic lethality. domain: gene range: gene Here we define a human readable description that describes the predicate slot genetically interacts with and its purpose. slot_uri The slot_uri slot can be used to define a canonical URI that is the true representation for that particular slot. That is, the value of slot_uri can be used interchangably with the slot being defined. name: is_a: node property aliases: ['label', 'display name'] domain: named thing range: label type slot_uri: rdfs:label Here we define rdfs:label as the canonical URI for the property slot name . When serializing a graph into RDF, the name of an instance of entity class named thing will be represented using rdfs:label instead of biolink:name . This is to ensure that we use certain core RDF predicates as is. in_subset The in_subset slot can be used tag your class (or slot) to belong to a pre-defined subset. The actual subset names are defined as part of the Schema definition. genetically interacts with: is_a: interacts with domain: gene range: gene in_subset: - translator_minimal Here we define the predicate slot genetically interacts with as part of the translator_minimal subset. id_prefixes The id_prefixes slot can be used to define a list of valid ID prefixes that instances of this class ought to have as part of their CURIE. The order of the list matters since its a prioritized list with the ID prefix with the highest priority appearing at the top of the list. gene: is_a: gene or gene product aliases: ['locus'] slots: - id - name - symbol - description - synonym - xref mappings: - SO:0000704 - SIO:010035 - WIKIDATA:Q7187 id_prefixes: - NCBIGene - ENSEMBL - HGNC - UniProtKB - MGI - ZFIN - dictyBase - WB - WormBase - FlyBase - FB - RGD - SGD - PomBase Here we define the entity class gene to have a list of ID prefixes with NCBIGene having the highest priority. Slots Relating to Class Composition slots The slot property list enumerates the names of slots which a given class, mixin or its subclasses are generally permitted to have. Unless it is designated as one of the defining_slots (see below) or slot_usage (see below) specifies that a given slot is required: true (see below), then it is not mandatory that such a slot is instantiated in all instances of the given class, mixin or subclass inheriting it. defining_slots The defining_slots slot can be used to specify which slots of an instance are necessary for defining an instance as a member of a class. gene to gene association: is_a: association defining_slots: - subject - object Here we specify that an association can be determined to be an instance of class gene to gene association based on the semantics of two of its slots: subject and object . i.e. One can infer an association to be an instance of gene to gene association if both its subject and its object are an instances of class gene . Listing a slot as one of the defining_slots slots effectively makes it required: true (see below). slot_usage The slot_usage slot can be used to specify how a particular slot ought to be used in a class. This is useful for documenting what a particular slot means for instances of a particular class. gene to gene association: aliases: ['molecular or genetic interaction'] is_a: association defining_slots: - subject - object description: >- abstract parent class for different kinds of gene-gene or gene product to gene product relationships. Includes homology and interaction. slot_usage: subject: range: gene or gene product description: >- the subject gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa object: range: gene or gene product description: >- the object gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric, subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as proxy for the gene or vice versa Here we document the association class gene to gene association with information on how the slot subject and object ought to be used to represent this association properly. In the slot_usage section we define the range and provide a description for the slot subject and object . required The required slot can be used to define whether a slot is required. When a slot is declared as required, any class that uses that slot must have a value for that slot. id: is_a: node property required: true domain: named thing mappings: - alliancegenome:primaryId - gff3:ID - gpi:DB_Object_ID Here we define the property slot id as a required field for all instances of the entity class named thing . Slots Relating to Constraints on Slot Composition domain The domain slot mimics the idea of rdfs:domain where you constrain the type of classes that a given Biolink Model slot can be a part of. genetically interacts with: is_a: interacts with domain: gene Here we define that the subject (source node) of the predicate slot genetically interacts with must be an instance of class gene . range The range slot mimics the idea of rdfs:range where you can constrain the type of classes (or data types) a given Biolink Model slot can have as its value. genetically interacts with: is_a: interacts with domain: gene range: gene Here we define that both the subject (source node) and object (target node) of the predicate slot genetically interacts with must be instances of class gene . symmetric The symmetric slot can be used to specify whether a Biolink Model predicate slot is symmetric in its semantics. i.e. if A -[r]-> B and r is symmetric then one can infer B -[r]-> A genetically interacts with: is_a: interacts with domain: gene range: gene in_subset: - translator_minimal symmetric: true Here we define that the predicate slot genetically interacts with is symmetric. Note: This property is not inherited by descendants of this predicate slot. You will have to explicitly define every predicate slot that should be considered as symmetric. Slots Relating Semantic Mappings and Anchoring to External Ontology symmetric The symmetric slot can be used to specify whether a given predicate slot is symmetric. interacts with: domain: named thing range: named thing description: >- holds between any two entities that directly or indirectly interact with each other is_a: related to in_subset: - translator_minimal symmetric: true Note: The symmetric nature of the predicate is not inherited by descendants of the predicate. inverse The inverse slot can be used to specify the inverse predicate of a given predicate slot relationship. affects: is_a: related to description: >- describes an entity that has a direct affect on the state or quality of another existing entity. Use of the 'affects' predicate implies that the affected entity already exists, unlike predicates such as 'affects risk for' and 'prevents, where the outcome is something that may or may not come to be. inverse: affected by in_subset: - translator_minimal exact_mappings The exact_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be exact mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. same as: is_a: exact match description: >- holds between two entities that are considered equivalent to each other in_subset: - translator_minimal exact_mappings: - owl:sameAs - skos:exactMatch - WIKIDATA_PROPERTY:P2888 - CHEMBL.MECHANISM:equivalent_to - MONDO:equivalentTo Here we define a list of 5 predicates that are semantically equivalent to the Biolink Model predicate slot same as . close_mappings The close_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be close mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. same as: is_a: exact match description: >- holds between two entities that are considered equivalent to each other in_subset: - translator_minimal exact_mappings: - owl:sameAs - skos:exactMatch - WIKIDATA_PROPERTY:P2888 - CHEMBL.MECHANISM:equivalent_to - MONDO:equivalentTo close_mappings: - owl:equivalentClass Here we define owl:equivalentClass as being a close match to the Biolink Model predicate slot same as . narrow_mappings The narrow_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be narrow mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. same as: is_a: exact match description: >- holds between two entities that are considered equivalent to each other in_subset: - translator_minimal close_mappings: - owl:equivalentClass exact_mappings: - owl:sameAs - skos:exactMatch - WIKIDATA_PROPERTY:P2888 - CHEMBL.MECHANISM:equivalent_to - MONDO:equivalentTo narrow_mappings: - DRUGBANK:external-identifier Here we define DRUGBANK:external-identifier as being a narrow match to the predicate slot same as . By narrow we mean that the scope of DRUGBANK:external-identifier is more narrower and restrictive than same as . If we were to create a new predicate slot as a proxy for DRUGBANK:external-identifier then that new slot would be a child of same as . broad_mappings The broad_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be broad mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. in complex with: description: >- holds between two genes or gene products that are part of (or code for products that are part of) in the same macromolecular complex is_a: coexists with domain: gene or gene product range: gene or gene product in_subset: - translator_minimal broad_mappings: - SIO:010285 Here we define SIO:010285 (molecular complex formation) as a broad mapping to the predicate slot in complex with .

If we were to create a new predicate slot as a proxy for SIO:010285 then that new slot would be a parent of in complex with . related_mappings The related_mappings slot can be used to define external concepts, predicates, or properties which are considered to be related mappings to the class (or slot) being defined. in complex with: description: >- holds between two genes or gene products that are part of (or code for products that are part of) in the same macromolecular complex is_a: coexists with domain: gene or gene product range: gene or gene product in_subset: - translator_minimal broad_mappings: - SIO:010285 related_mappings: - SIO:010497 Here we define SIO:010497 (protein complex) as a related mapping to the predicate slot in complex with . By related we mean that the scope of SIO:010497 is related to the predicate slot in complex with and it's difficult to infer any further granularity. subproperty_of The subproperty_of slot can be used (typically, under slot_usage ) to anchor the values of a Biolink predicate slot of an association to a particular predicate (and its subclasses) other than the top-most predicate, biolink:related_to . gene to gene homology association: is_a: gene to gene association slot_usage: predicate: subproperty_of: homologous to Here, the predicate of the biolink:GeneToGeneHomologyAssociation is constrained to a value the subtree of predicates of biolink:homologous_to or its subclasses. subclass_of The subclass_of slot can be used to anchor the semantics of a Biolink class to a particular term in an external 3rd party ontology. named thing: description: \"a databased entity or concept/class\" slots: - id - name - category subclass_of: BFO:0000001 Here, biolink:NamedThing is anchored to ontology term BFO:0000001 - Entity of the Basic Formal Ontology which implies all is_a specified subclasses of biolink:NamedThing are also a subclasses of BFO:0000001 .","title":"Using the Modeling Language"},{"location":"using-the-modeling-language/#using-the-modeling-language","text":"Overview Inheritance Related Slots is_a abstract mixin mixins Identification, Descriptive and Indexing Related Slots aliases description slot_uri in_subset id_prefixes Slots Relating to Class Composition slots defining_slots slot_usage required Slots Relating to Constraints on Slot Composition domain range symmetric Slots Relating Semantic Mappings and Anchoring to External Ontology symmetric inverse exact_mappings close_mappings narrow_mappings broad_mappings related_mappings subproperty_of subclass_of","title":"Using the Modeling Language"},{"location":"using-the-modeling-language/#overview","text":"The linkML provides a variety of slots to define the semantics of your Biolink Model class and slots.

Mixins can be extremely helpful in a number of ways: 1) to generalize a set of attributes that can apply to classes in different parts of the class hierarchy, 2) reduce duplication of shared attributes between classes that do not inherit from one another and 3) to prevent the sometimes confusing nature of multiple inheritance noted in the '[diamond problem]'(https://tinyurl.com/4zdw9tsb). In general, while mixin slots and classes should not be directly instantiated, or used directly as a slot in a class, KGs can use them as a substitute for multiple inheritance. For example, a KG might wish to determine what are the parents of a certain class. In this case, the KG should navigate a mixin used in a domain or range of a class or slot, as it would the \"is_a\" demarkation. thing with taxon: mixin: true description: >- A mixin that can be used on any entity with a taxon slots: - in taxon Here we define the class thing with taxon as a mixin class with a slot in taxon . molecular entity: is_a: biological entity mixins: - thing with taxon - physical essence - ontology class aliases: ['bioentity'] In the class molecular entity , we use the thing with taxon mixin in order to add the 'in taxon' attribute (slot) to the molecular entity class. The other way to do this would be to duplicate the 'in taxon' attribute in every class manually (duplicative), or have hierarchy/parent that had the in taxon slot (but this parent would be a sister-class to 'named thing' as not all named-things are taxon based). Mixins simplify modeling and should be used when necessary. regulates: is_a: affects comments: - This is a grouping for process-process and entity-entity relations mixin: true Here we define the slot regulates as a mixin slot. This slot can be used as a mixin by other slots. Mixins can also be hierarchical. For example: frequency qualifier mixin: mixin: true description: >- Qualifier for frequency type associations slots: - frequency qualifier Here we define the mixin frequency qualifier mixin to hold the parent slot, frequency qualifier. The slot, frequency qualifier is then inherited by every class in the subsequent is_a hierarchy of entity to feature or disease qualifiers mixin. The frequency quantifier mixin was created with similar intentions (favoring consistency in modeling similar domains), though its reuse is not as evident in the model yet. Mixins provide the means of reusing semantics, generally by the inclusion of specific property slots or other semantic constraint, in different classes or slots, without the need to tie slots to the hierarchy of the class itself. positively regulates: comments: - This is a grouping for positive process-process and entity-entity regulation. is_a: regulates inverse: positively regulated by mixin: true close_mappings: # This RTX contributed term is tagged as a inverse of this Biolink predicate - RO:0002336 exact_mappings: - RO:0002213 narrow_mappings: - CHEMBL.MECHANISM:activator - DGIdb:activator - RO:0004032 - RO:0004034 - RO:0002629 - SEMMEDDB:augments positively regulates is another example of a mixin.
