  publication:

      Any published piece of information. Can refer to a whole publication,
      its encompassing publication (i.e. journal or book) or to a part of a
      publication, if of significant knowledge scope (e.g. a figure, figure
      legend, or section highlighted by NLP). The scope is intended to be
      general and include information published on the web, as well as printed
      materials, either directly or in one of the Publication Biolink
      category subclasses.

          Different kinds of publication subtypes will have different preferred
          identifiers (curies when feasible). Precedence of identifiers for
          scientific articles is as follows: PMID if available; DOI if not; actual
          alternate CURIE otherwise. Enclosing publications (i.e. referenced by
          'published in' node property) such as books and journals, should have
          industry-standard identifier such as from ISBN and ISSN.
      name:
        description: >-
          the 'title' of the publication is generally recorded in the 'name'
          property (inherited from NamedThing). The field name 'title' is now also
          tagged as an acceptable alias for the node property 'name' (just in case).

          Ontology term for publication type may be drawn from
          Dublin Core types (https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-type-vocabulary/),
          FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (https://sparontologies.github.io/fabio/current/fabio.html),

          the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR) Controlled Vocabulary for Resource Type Genres
          (http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/resource_types/),
          Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Publication_types), or
          equivalent publication type ontology. When a given publication type ontology term
          is used within a given knowledge graph, then the CURIE identified term must be
          documented in the graph as a concept node of biolink:category biolink:OntologyClass.
