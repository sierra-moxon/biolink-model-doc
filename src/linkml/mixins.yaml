classes:

  increases amount or activity of:
    is_a: related to at instance level
    mixin: true
    description: >-
      A grouping mixin to help with searching for all the predicates that increase the amount
      or activity of the object.

    is_a: related to at instance level
    mixin: true
    description: >-
      A grouping mixin to help with searching for all the predicates that decrease the amount
      or activity of the object.

  ## role mixins for use in tagging corresponding role predicates

  chemical role mixin:
    description: >-
      A role played by the chemical entity or part thereof within a chemical context.
    mixin: true
    exact_mappings:
      - CHEBI:51086

  biological role mixin:
    description: >-
      A role played by the chemical entity or part thereof within a biological context.
    mixin: true
    narrow_mappings:
      - CHEBI:24432

  regulates:
    is_a: affects
    description: >-
      A more specific form of affects, that implies the effect results from a biologically evolved control mechanism.
      Gene-affects-gene relationships will (almost) always involve regulation.  Chemical-affects-gene relationships 
      may in some cases be considered regulation (if the chemical is some endogenously produced signaling molecule 
      created to execute a certain function/activity), but exogenous/environmental chemical-affects-gene relationships 
      are usually not cases of regulation.

  ontology class:
    mixin: true
    slots:
      - id
    description: >-
      a concept or class in an ontology, vocabulary or thesaurus. Note that nodes in
      a biolink compatible KG can be considered both instances of biolink classes, and
      OWL classes in their own right. In general you should not need to use this class directly.
      Instead, use the appropriate biolink class. For example, for the GO concept of endocytosis (GO:0006897),
      use bl:BiologicalProcess as the type.
    exact_mappings:
      - owl:Class
      - schema:Class
    comments:
      - >-
         This is modeled as a mixin. 'ontology class' should not be the primary type of a
         node in the KG. Instead you should use an informative bioloink category, such as AnatomicalEntity
         (for Uberon classes), ChemicalSubstance (for CHEBI or CHEMBL), etc
      - >-
         Note that formally this is a metaclass. Instances of this class are instances in the graph,
         but can be the object of 'type' edges. For example, if we had a node in the graph representing
         a specific brain of a specific patient (e.g brain001), this could have a category of bl:Sample,
         and by typed more specifically with an ontology class UBERON:nnn, which has as category bl:AnatomicalEntity
