      Expresses a relationship between two named things where the relationship is typically generated statistically

      dependence is demonstrated.  E.g. the statement “Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) is associated with Myocardial 
      Infarction (MI)” asserts that having Afib is not statistically independent from whether a patient 
      will also have MI. Note that in Translator associations, the subject and object concepts may map exactly to 
      the statistical variables, or represent related entities for which the variables serve as proxies in an 
      Association (e.g. diseases, chemical entities or processes).

      A more specific form of affects, that implies the effect results from a biologically evolved control mechanism.
      Gene-affects-gene relationships will (almost) always involve regulation.  Chemical-affects-gene relationships 
      may in some cases be considered regulation (if the chemical is some endogenously produced signaling molecule 
      created to execute a certain function/activity), but exogenous/environmental chemical-affects-gene relationships 
      are usually not cases of regulation.
