  population context qualifier:
    description: >-
      a biological population (general, study, cohort, etc.) with a specific
      set of characteristics to constrain an association.
    is_a: association slot
    range: population of individual organisms

  temporal context qualifier:
    description: >-
      a constraint of time placed upon the truth value of an association.
      for time intervales, use temporal interval qualifier.
    is_a: association slot
    range: time type

  temporal interval qualifier:
    is_a: temporal context qualifier
    description: >- 
      a constraint of a time interval placed upon the truth value of an
      association.

  form or variant qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object concept to define a specific type, variant,
      alternative version of this concept. The composed concept remains a subtype or instance of the core concept.
      For example, the qualifier ‘mutation’ combines with the core concept ‘Gene X’ to express the compose concept
      ‘a mutation of Gene X’.
    examples:
      - value: mutation
    notes: >-
      please see the chemical_or_gene_or_gene_product_form_enum (below) for examples of 'form or variant qualifier'
      terms in the gene->chemical association space. 

  aspect qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which
      the core concept participates, a function/activity/role held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that
      inheres in the core concept.
    examples:
      - value: stability
      - value: abundance
      - value: expression
      - value: exposure
    notes: >-
      for good examples of aspects in the gene-> chemical space, please see the 
      gene_or_gene_product_or_chemical_entity_aspect_enum (below) which lists many aspects that can be used to qualify 
      the gene making the full subject a different ontological type.  

  derivative qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object  concept to describe something that is derived from the
      core concept.  For example, the qualifier ‘metabolite’ combines with a ‘Chemical X’ core concept to express
      the composed concept ‘a metabolite of Chemical X’.
    examples:
      - value: metabolite

  part qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      defines a specific part/component of the core concept (used in cases there this specific part has no IRI we can

      - value: polyA tail
      - value: upstream control region

  context qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
